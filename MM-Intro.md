# Minutes

This is what the meeting was about. It was about a lot of things, it was about a couple things, it was maybe about nothing at all really. I wish I could tell you that it was more than nothing but to be perfectly honest I don't remember anything at all. Perhaps it was about the universe and its entire continuum perhaps it was about the cheese I had last week. Most likely though it was not important and remembering it matters to nobody at all. All I do remember was that a meeting was had, and much was said.
